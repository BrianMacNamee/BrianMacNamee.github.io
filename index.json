In this talk we will first explore what we mean by anomaly detection, and the different forms anomaly detection can take (as well as the relationship with other similar topics, e.g. novelty detection and outlier detection). We will then survey the machine leanring app[roaches that can be used for anomaly detection and when the are most effective.","tags":[],"title":"That's Funny: Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Brian Mac Namee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501512152,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501512152,"objectID":"ca822f22f92900b4ef4c8cb4bf68b0d4","permalink":"https://brianmacnamee.github.io/talk/show_me_your_data_dublin_data_summit/","publishdate":"2017-07-31T14:42:32Z","relpermalink":"/talk/show_me_your_data_dublin_data_summit/","section":"talk","summary":"A huge amount of our daily activities now create a digital footprint - every phone call or SMS; every Facebook like or Tweet; every email; every online purchase; every Wi-Fi network joined or every work-out session recorded.
